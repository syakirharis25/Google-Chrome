# HTML5 Project: Build a Landing Page for a Burger Restaurant

The project is designed for beginners to tackle a medium sized HTML focused project, and the main aim is for learners to consolidate everything we have covered on HTML up until now. 

We will build out the complete HTML markup structure for this [finished project](https://codepen.io/SymposiumSchool/pen/xoEEpz?editors=1000) from scratch. **Note: There is some CSS & JavaScript also included in the project but that has been pre-written.**

This project is covered over a two part video walkthrough:
